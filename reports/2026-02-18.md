## Claude Analysis (Main — Real)
**Market View:** EU markets showing broad strength today with industrial and tech sectors leading — SIE.DE up 3.2% on raised guidance, ASML up 0.9%. US markets are more mixed with MSFT down 1.1% ahead of ex-dividend and NVDA facing binary earnings risk next week. Conservative approach favors EU names with strong fundamentals and near-term catalysts over US mega-caps facing event risk.

**Confidence:** 72%

### Picked
| Ticker | Action | Allocation | Reasoning |
|--------|--------|------------|-----------|
| SIE.DE | buy | 60% | Highest conviction pick: fundamental 8.5/10, risk only 4/10, just raised FY2026 guidance on AI/data center demand with digital profit up 37%. Strong multi-source sentiment (0.68) and up 3.2% today on momentum. Not yet in portfolio, adds industrial automation exposure. |
| INGA.AS | buy | 40% | Solid value banking play with P/E 11.7, 4.44% dividend yield, upgraded to Strong Buy. Diversifies portfolio into EU financials with manageable 4.5 risk score. RSI neutral at 51.3 suggests fair entry point. |

### Risk Review
**Notes:** Portfolio has ~45% technology concentration from existing positions (NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, DSY.PA, ADYEN). Adding SIE.DE and INGA.AS provides sector diversification (Industrials + Financials). Both picks have low risk scores (3.0) with solid fundamentals. No sector exceeds 60% threshold after additions. Existing NVDA position has earnings Feb 25 - monitoring recommended but not blocking.

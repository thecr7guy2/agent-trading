Get rid of the dual LLM competetion thing hurting a lot - For tool calls use minmax for decision making use sonnet or opus
Implement the paper trading thing - Instead of the dual competetion, this would be a really good idea One track with paper trading and one track with real trading - Riskier stocks in paper trading , A bit safer stocks in real trading.
Implement the ceo filing stocks (bafin) data as a data source

Add a probe trace which shows me output/input fo evbery other agent.
